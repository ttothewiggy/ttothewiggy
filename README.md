- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alex Evans
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning as much as I can about web design, software development and anything in between. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript, C#, SQL, Docker and many more at Toi Ohomai. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm also working through the Odin Project in my spare time.
- ðŸ‘€ Looking for any IT related work around the Tauranga, Papamoa, Mount Maunganui area. 

- ðŸ“« Reach me at alexdavidevans@gmail.com

- ðŸ‘€ Take a look at my [Today I learned](https://github.com/ttothewiggy/TIL) repo to keep up to date on what I've been working on. 

Today I Learned is a collection of notes, cheatsheets, diary entries and tricks I've learnt from my studies and work. It's like a cashiers till that stores all the valuable money from a days work. This personal TIL holds all the information I've been learning on my journey into IT.
